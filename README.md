# Project's name

## Description

The objective of the game is to bounce the coconuts falling from the palm trees with a bar in such a way that the monkeys could catch them.

On stage there will be 3 palm trees, 2 on the sides and 1 in the middle of which you will see only the top.
In the 2 palm trees on the sides halfway up there will be 2 monkeys.
Randomly of each of the palm trees will fall coconuts one by one.
At the bottom of the screen there will be a bar with which the player can bounce the coconuts by controlling it with the computer mouse.
The player at the beginning has 3 lives.
If the player bounces the coconut at such an angle that one of the monkeys can take it, he wins a point. If the coconut falls, the player loses a life.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
